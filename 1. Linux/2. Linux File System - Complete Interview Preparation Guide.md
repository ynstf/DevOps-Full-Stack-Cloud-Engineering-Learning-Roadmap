# 📁 Linux File System - Complete Interview Preparation Guide

## 📌 Overview

The Linux File System is foundational to understanding how Linux operates. Whether you're a system administrator, developer, or prepping for an interview, this guide will give you a comprehensive theoretical and hands-on walkthrough of the Linux file system.

We cover:

* The layout and purpose of each directory
* Differences from Windows and macOS
* Important commands to explore and manipulate the file system
* Real-world examples

## 🧭 What is the Linux File System?

The Linux File System is a **hierarchical directory structure** that begins at the root directory `/` and branches out. Unlike Windows, Linux:

* Does **not** use drive letters like C: or D:
* Treats **everything as a file**, including hardware, configurations, and commands
* Is **case-sensitive**, so `File`, `file`, and `FILE` are different

The structure is based on the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**, maintained by the Linux Foundation.

## 📂 Essential Directories and Their Purpose

| Directory                  | Purpose                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                        | Root of the filesystem (everything starts here)          |
| `/bin`                     | Essential user command binaries (e.g. `ls`, `cat`)       |
| `/sbin`                    | System binaries used by the administrator                |
| `/boot`                    | Bootloader files (e.g. GRUB, initrd)                     |

| `/lib`, `/lib32`, `/lib64` | Libraries required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`     |
| `/media`                   | Mount point for removable media (auto-mounted USBs, CDs) |
| `/mnt`                     | Temporary mount points for system admins                 |
| `/opt`                     | Optional software and third-party packages               |
| `/proc`                    | Kernel and process information (virtual files)           |
| `/root`                    | Root user's home directory                               |
| `/run`                     | Runtime variable data (stored in RAM)                    |
| `/snap`                    | Snap packages (mainly on Ubuntu)                         |
| `/srv`                     | Service data (web, FTP, etc.)                            |
| `/sys`                     | Virtual kernel information (similar to `/proc`)          |
| `/tmp`                     | Temporary files (cleared on reboot)                      |
| `/usr`                     | Secondary hierarchy: user applications, libraries, docs  |
| `/var`                     | Variable data (logs, mail, spools, cache)                |

## 🔧 Important Commands

### 🟩 Navigation

```bash
pwd                 # Show current directory
ls                  # List contents
cd /path/to/dir     # Change directory
cd ~                # Go to home
cd ..               # Go up one level
clear               # Clear the terminal
```

### 🟩 Exploring Directories

```bash
ls -l /             # List files in root
ls -lh /etc         # List with sizes in human-readable format
ls -a               # Show hidden files (e.g. .bashrc)
```

### 🟩 File Manipulation

```bash
cat /etc/hostname   # Show content of a file
cp file1 file2      # Copy files
mv file1 file2      # Rename or move files
rm file             # Delete a file
```

### 🟩 With Permissions

```bash
sudo ls /root       # Need root access
sudo cp file /root/ # Copy into root-owned directory
```

## 🛠️ Practical Examples

### 🔍 View Directory Structure

```bash
ls /
```

Shows core Linux directories:

```
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

### 🧪 View Devices

```bash
ls /dev
```

Look for:

* `sda`, `sda1` — hard drives and partitions
* `tty*` — terminals
* `null`, `zero`, `random` — pseudo-devices

### 🔄 Mounting USB Drive

```bash
# Auto-mounted:
/media/username/device-name

# Manual mount:
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
```

### 📁 View Configurations

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
cat /etc/network/interfaces
```

These show OS information and network configs respectively.

## 🧑‍💻 Deep Dives: Special Directories

### `/proc`

Contains system and process data. Example:

```bash
cat /proc/cpuinfo    # CPU details
cat /proc/meminfo    # RAM details
```

### `/sys`

Virtual filesystem that exposes kernel device trees.

```bash
ls /sys/class/net    # Network interfaces
```

### `/root`

```bash
sudo ls /root        # Home directory of the root user
```

### `/tmp`

Used for temporary files:

```bash
cd /tmp
ls -la
```

Files are auto-deleted on reboot.

## ⚠️ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is the difference between `/bin` and `/sbin`?

* `/bin` holds essential user commands.
* `/sbin` holds system administration binaries.

### Q2: How does Linux treat devices?

* As files under `/dev`, e.g., `/dev/sda` for a hard drive.

### Q3: What is the purpose of `/etc`?

* System-wide configuration files live here.

### Q4: Where do users store personal files?

* In `/home/username` directories.

### Q5: Why are `/proc` and `/sys` virtual filesystems?

* They're dynamically generated by the kernel and exist only in memory.

### Q6: What’s the difference between `/mnt` and `/media`?

* `/mnt` is for manual mounts by admins.
* `/media` is used for auto-mounted devices.

## 🧠 Flashcards

* **What is `/dev`?** → Device files
* **What is `/opt`?** → Optional third-party software

---

## 🔚 Summary

* The Linux File System is powerful, flexible, and follows the FHS standard.
* Everything is treated as a file — commands, devices, configs.
* System understanding improves drastically by exploring key directories.

**Practice and explore daily to build muscle memory. Make mistakes. Use sandboxes like HackTheBox or VMs.**
