# 🐚 Bash Scripting Crash Course - Interview-Ready Guide

## 📌 Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive, interview-focused overview of **Bash scripting** — one of the most powerful tools for automating tasks on Unix/Linux systems. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or DevOps engineer, mastering Bash scripting can greatly enhance your productivity and system understanding.

We'll cover:

* What Bash is and why it's used
* Core syntax: commands, variables, input/output, conditionals, loops
* Practical examples with scripts
* Key utilities: `awk`, `sed`, redirection, functions, arrays
* Interview-ready theory and hands-on exercises

## 🔍 What is Bash?

* **Bash** = *Bourne Again Shell*, a replacement for the original Bourne Shell (`sh`)
* Default on most Linux distros, macOS, and available via **WSL** on Windows
* Lightweight, fast, and highly scriptable

### ✅ Why Use Bash?

* Excellent for automating server maintenance and data pipelines
* Perfect for writing cron jobs, install scripts, and lightweight DevOps tasks
* Ubiquitous in Unix/Linux environments

### ⚠️ When Not to Use Bash

* Complex applications requiring OOP or data structures → use **Python** or other languages
* Large-scale infrastructure automation → consider **Ansible**

## 🚀 Getting Started with Bash Scripts

### 📝 Writing and Running Your First Script

```bash
vim hello.sh
```

Inside Vim:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

Save with `:wq`, then:

```bash
chmod u+x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

> 🔥 Use `#!/bin/bash` (shebang) to specify the interpreter.

---

## 🔤 Variables and Input

### ➕ Defining Variables

```bash
first_name="Herbert"
echo "Hello, $first_name"
```

### 🧠 User Input with `read`

```bash
read -p "What is your name? " name
echo "Hello, $name"
```

### 📌 Positional Parameters

* `$0` = script name
* `$1`, `$2`, ... = first, second, etc., arguments

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, $1 $2"
# Run: ./script.sh John Doe
```

---

## 🧪 Conditions and Tests

### 📗 `if`, `elif`, `else`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" == "admin" ]; then
  echo "Welcome, admin"
elif [ "$1" == "help" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./script.sh <username>"
else
  echo "Access denied"
fi
```

### 📙 Case Statements

```bash
case "$1" in
  admin|root)
    echo "You're the boss";;
  help)
    echo "Usage: ./script.sh <username>";;
  *)
    echo "Unknown user";;
esac
```

### ✅ Testing Conditions

```bash
[ "$a" == "$b" ]          # String equality
[ $a -eq $b ]              # Numeric equality
[ -f file.txt ]            # File exists
[ -d /path/to/dir ]        # Directory exists
```

Use `echo $?` to get exit code.

## 🔁 Loops and Arrays

### 🔃 For Loop

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do
  echo $i
done
```

### 📦 Arrays

```bash
my_array=(apple banana cherry)
echo ${my_array[0]}          # apple
for item in "${my_array[@]}"; do echo $item; done
```

---

## 🧩 Functions

```bash
show_uptime() {
  local uptime_info=$(uptime -p)
  echo "Uptime: $uptime_info"
}

show_uptime
```

### ➕ Functions with Parameters

```bash
greet_user() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet_user "Alice"
```

---

## 📥 Input/Output Redirection

### 🔁 Redirect Output

```bash
echo "Hello" > hello.txt     # overwrite
cat file.txt >> combined.txt # append
```

### 📤 Redirect Input

```bash
wc -w < file.txt
```

### 📌 Here Documents and Strings

```bash
cat <<EOF
Line 1
Line 2
EOF

wc -w <<< "Hello Bash Scripting"
```

---

## 🛠 Useful Tools

### 🔍 `grep` with Pipes

```bash
ls -l /usr/bin | grep bash
```

### 🧮 `awk` for Field Extraction

```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt
awk -F, '{print $2}' file.csv
```

### ✏️ `sed` for Substitution

```bash
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
sed -i.bak 's/old/new/g' file.txt  # in-place with backup
```

## ❓ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: How do you execute a Bash script?

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

### Q2: What is `$?` used for?

Shows the **exit code** of the last command (0 = success).

### Q3: Difference between `>` and `>>`?

* `>` overwrites a file
* `>>` appends to a file

### Q4: What is the use of `local` in functions?

To limit a variable’s scope to the function.

### Q5: How do you pass and use arguments?

Via `$1`, `$2`, etc., or use `read` for interactive input.

## 🧠 Flashcards

* **Define a function?** → `myfunc() { ... }`
* **Get first argument in script?** → `$1`
* **Append to file?** → `>>`
* **Replace text in file?** → `sed 's/old/new/g' file`
* **Print last command exit code?** → `$?`

## ✅ Practice Checklist

✅ Write a Hello World script

✅ Create and use variables and positional parameters

✅ Practice `if`, `case`, `for` loops

✅ Use `awk`, `sed`, `grep` to manipulate text

✅ Build a script with logging and user prompts

✅ Modularize with functions and local variables
