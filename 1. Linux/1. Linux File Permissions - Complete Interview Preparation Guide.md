# Linux File Permissions - Complete Interview Preparation Guide

## 📌 Overview

Understanding Linux file permissions is critical for any aspiring Linux user, systems administrator, or developer. Whether you're preparing for an interview or simply looking to strengthen your practical command over Linux, this guide covers both theoretical and practical knowledge related to file permissions.

We will explain:

* What file permissions are
* The structure of permission strings
* How to change ownership and permissions
* Symbolic vs numeric modes
* Real-world examples with commands

## 📁 The Basics of File Permissions

Every file and directory in Linux has **three permission groups**:

1. **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
2. **Group**: The group assigned to the file.
3. **Others**: All other users.

Each group has **three types of permissions**:

* `r` (read)    → Read the contents of a file / list contents of a directory.
* `w` (write)   → Modify the contents of a file / create or delete files in a directory.
* `x` (execute) → Run the file as a program / access the directory.

---

## 🔍 Understanding the Permission String

Use the command:

```bash
ls -l
```

Example Output:

```
drwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu     4096 Jun 3 10:00 files
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu     1024 Jun 3 10:00 myconfig.yaml
```

Breakdown:

* The first character: `d` = directory, `-` = file
* Next 3 characters: Owner permissions
* Next 3: Group permissions
* Last 3: Others permissions

For example: `-rw-r--r--`

* `-` → regular file
* `rw-` → owner can read/write
* `r--` → group can only read
* `r--` → others can only read

---

## 🛠 Changing Ownership: `chown`

Command format:

```bash
sudo chown [user] [file]
sudo chown [user]:[group] [file]
```

Examples:

```bash
sudo chown travis myconfig.yaml
sudo chown travis:travismedia myconfig.yaml
```

Check the changes:

```bash
ls -l myconfig.yaml
```

---

## 🔐 Changing Permissions: `chmod`

### Numeric Mode (Octal)

Permissions use a binary model:

* Read (r) = 4
* Write (w) = 2
* Execute (x) = 1

Add values for each group:

* `rwx` → 4+2+1 = 7
* `rw-` → 4+2 = 6
* `r--` → 4

#### Example Breakdown

```bash
-rw-rw-r-- → 664
-rwxrwxr-x → 775
-r-------- → 400
```

### Change Permission with `chmod`

```bash
sudo chmod 774 main.py
sudo chmod 400 mykey.pem
```

### Symbolic Mode (Optional for Interviews)

```bash
chmod u+x file     # Add execute for user
chmod g-w file     # Remove write from group
chmod o=r file     # Others can only read
```

## 📂 Common Permission Sets

| Use Case          | Symbolic   | Numeric |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Default file      | -rw-r--r-- | 644     |
| Default directory | drwxr-xr-x | 755     |
| Executable script | -rwxr-xr-x | 755     |
| SSH private key   | -r-------- | 400     |
| Public directory  | drwxrwxrwx | 777     |
| Restricted access | -rw------- | 600     |

---

## 🔍 Practical Exercise

1. **List files and their permissions:**

```bash
ls -l
```

2. **Change file owner:**

```bash
sudo chown username:groupname myfile.txt
```

3. **Change permissions to allow execute for owner:**

```bash
sudo chmod u+x myscript.sh
```

4. **Secure SSH key:**

```bash
sudo chmod 400 mykey.pem
```

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Never use `777` in production unless absolutely necessary.
* Directories require `x` to be accessible.
* Files need `x` to be executable.
* Use `ls -ld` to check directory permissions.
* Combine `chown` and `chmod` with `find` for batch operations.

```bash
find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
```

---

## ❓ Interview Questions

**1. What does `chmod 755` mean?**

* Owner: read, write, execute (7)
* Group: read, execute (5)
* Others: read, execute (5)

**2. What command would you use to change both user and group ownership of a file?**

* `sudo chown user:group file`

**3. Why is 400 used for private keys?**

* To restrict access so only the owner can read it (a security best practice).

**4. How do you make a file executable?**

* `chmod +x file` or `chmod 755 file`

**5. How do Linux permissions impact directory behavior?**

* Without `x`, a user can't traverse or list the contents of a directory.

## 📝 Cheat Sheet Summary

* `r = 4`, `w = 2`, `x = 1`
* Combine permissions: 7 = rwx, 6 = rw-, 5 = r-x, 4 = r--
* `chmod 644 file` – secure file
* `chmod 755 dir` – accessible directory
* `chown user file`, `chown user:group file`
* Use `ls -l` to inspect permissions

## 👥 Understanding Owner, Group, and Others

In Linux, every file and directory has associated metadata that defines who can access it and how. These metadata include three categories of users:

### 👤 Owner (User)

* The **Owner** is typically the user who created the file or directory.
* Has the most control over the file, often with read and write permissions by default.
* Only one user can own a file at a time.

### 👥 Group

* The **Group** is a set of users who share common permissions.
* Each file is assigned one group.
* All users in that group inherit the group-level permissions.

### 🌍 Others

* **Others** refers to all users on the system who are neither the owner nor in the assigned group.
* This is the broadest category and often has the most restricted access.

## 🛠 Creating and Managing Users and Groups

### 🔹 Create a New User

```bash
sudo adduser alice
```

This creates a new user named `alice` and also creates a new group named `alice` by default.

### 🔹 Create a New Group

```bash
sudo groupadd devs
```

This creates a group called `devs`.

### 🔹 Add a User to a Group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG devs alice
```

This adds `alice` to the `devs` group.

### 🔹 View User's Groups

```bash
groups alice
```

Displays all groups the user `alice` belongs to.

### 🔹 Change File Owner and Group

```bash
sudo chown bob:devs myfile.txt
```

This changes the owner of `myfile.txt` to `bob` and the group to `devs`.

---

## 🔍 Viewing Ownership and Groups

Use `ls -l` to inspect files:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice devs 1234 Jun 3 12:00 myfile.txt
```

* `alice` → owner
* `devs` → group
* `others` → any other users not in the above categories

---

## 🧪 Example

### Scenario:

* User `alice` creates a script: `deploy.sh`
* She wants:

  * Full control for herself (owner)
  * Allow her team (`devs` group) to execute it
  * Restrict others from accessing it

### Steps:

```bash
sudo chown alice:devs deploy.sh
sudo chmod 750 deploy.sh
```

### Resulting Permissions:

```
-rwxr-x--- 1 alice devs 2048 Jun 3 12:30 deploy.sh
```

* `rwx` for owner
* `r-x` for group
* `---` for others

---

Understanding these categories helps in setting up secure and collaborative environments. By combining proper group management with permission settings, you can control access effectively across users and teams.
