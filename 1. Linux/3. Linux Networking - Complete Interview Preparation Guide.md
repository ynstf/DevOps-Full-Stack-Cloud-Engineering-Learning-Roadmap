# üåê Linux Networking - Complete Interview Preparation Guide

## üìå Overview

Networking is a critical skill for Linux system administrators, DevOps engineers, programmers, and anyone working with servers. This guide gives a deep, interview-ready explanation of how networking is implemented in Linux, from low-level system design to practical commands you will use daily.

We will cover:

* How Linux implements networking under the hood
* Sockets and how applications interact with network devices
* Common network inspection and troubleshooting commands
* Examples, command outputs, file paths, and concepts

## üß† Theoretical Foundation: Networking in Linux

### üîå Everything is a File ‚Äî Almost

In Linux, *everything is treated as a file*, including hardware devices. Networking follows this philosophy *partially*.

When a Network Interface Card (NIC) is plugged in:

1. It signals the **kernel**, which installs the appropriate **driver**.
2. Configuration files are created at:

   ```bash
   /sys/class/net/
   ```

   Each interface gets its own folder with:

   * `address`: MAC address
   * `mtu`: Maximum Transmission Unit
   * `speed`: Interface speed

These configuration files do not allow direct data transmission‚Äîthey configure the hardware.

### üß∞ Using Network Devices

To send or receive data, applications request a **virtual file** in memory, created by the kernel using a system call like:

```c
int sockfd = socket(domain, type, protocol);
```

This creates a **socket**, which is a file descriptor (positive integer) representing a communication endpoint.

* These sockets **do not** exist in `/dev` or `/sys`; they are kernel-managed objects.
* The abstraction allows applications to treat them as normal files (read/write).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Practical Commands for Linux Networking

### üìÑ View Network Interfaces

```bash
ifconfig              # (Older command)
ip a                 # Newer, recommended
ip -4 addr           # Show IPv4 addresses
ip -6 addr           # Show IPv6 addresses
```

#### üîç Sample Output (IPv4)

```
inet 192.168.1.5/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic eth0
```

* `inet` ‚Üí IPv4
* `inet6` ‚Üí IPv6
* `eth0` ‚Üí Interface name (e.g., Ethernet)
* `lo` ‚Üí Loopback (127.0.0.1)

### üìä View Active Network Connections

```bash
netstat                 # General network statistics
netstat -a              # All TCP/UDP listening/connected ports
netstat -at             # Only TCP
netstat -au             # Only UDP
netstat -l              # Listening ports
```

> üìå `netstat` may be replaced by `ss` in modern systems.

#### ‚úÖ Sample:

```
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
TCP   0      0      192.168.1.5:22          192.168.1.20:58000      ESTABLISHED
```

### üåê Make Network Requests: `curl`

`curl` lets you interact with HTTP endpoints:

```bash
curl https://example.com
```

#### Options:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.com -d "param1=value1"
curl -X GET https://api.com --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
curl -o output.html https://example.com   # Save output to a file
curl -I https://example.com               # Show only headers
```

### üß™ Example: Testing a JSON API

```bash
curl -X POST https://httpbin.org/post \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"name":"LinuxUser","role":"Admin"}'
```

Returns a JSON object echoing your request.

### üì° Check Reachability with `ping`

```bash
ping google.com
```

* Sends ICMP packets
* Shows latency and packet loss
* Stop with `Ctrl+C`

#### Sample:

```
64 bytes from google.com: icmp_seq=1 ttl=115 time=10.4 ms
```

## üìÅ Relevant Files & Directories

| Path                      | Description                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `/sys/class/net/`         | Configuration folders for interfaces        |
| `/etc/network/interfaces` | Static network configuration (Debian-based) |
| `/etc/netplan/`           | Ubuntu network configuration                |
| `/etc/hosts`              | Manual hostname-to-IP mapping               |
| `/etc/resolv.conf`        | DNS server configuration                    |

## ‚ùì Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is a socket in Linux?

A virtual file created in memory that allows applications to send/receive data via system calls like `socket()`.

### Q2: What does `ifconfig` do?

Displays details about all network interfaces, including IPs, MACs, and packet statistics.

### Q3: How do you check open network ports?

Use `netstat -a` or `ss -a` to list all active connections and listening ports.

### Q4: How is everything a file in networking?

While physical configuration files exist in `/sys`, data transmission is handled by in-memory virtual files (sockets) with file descriptors.

### Q5: How do you test if a host is online?

Use `ping hostname_or_ip` to send ICMP echo requests and check the response.
