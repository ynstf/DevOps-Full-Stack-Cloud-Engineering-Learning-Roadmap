# 💻 Linux Advanced Command Line - Complete Interview Preparation Guide

## 📌 Overview

This guide is for those who want to level up their command-line skills and master essential and advanced Linux commands. Whether you are a system administrator, developer, or interview candidate, this guide blends theory with practical use cases using examples, outputs, and best practices (excluding networking and file permissions).

---

## 🧪 1. Piping (`|`)

**Purpose**: Chain commands together by sending the output of one command into the input of the next.

### 🔧 Example:

```bash
ls | grep notes
```

Finds files with "notes" in their name.

```bash
cat contacts.txt | sort | uniq
```

Sorts and removes duplicate lines from a file.

```bash
history | grep ssh
```

Searches for past commands involving SSH.

---

## 🧱 2. Running Multiple Commands in One Line

### Syntax Options:

* `cmd1; cmd2` → Runs both, regardless of success.
* `cmd1 && cmd2` → Runs `cmd2` only if `cmd1` succeeds.
* `cmd1 || cmd2` → Runs `cmd2` only if `cmd1` fails.

### 🔧 Example:

```bash
mkdir test && cd test && touch main.py
```

Creates a directory, enters it, and creates a file—all in one line.

```bash
cd /etc || echo "Failed to change directory"
```

If changing directory fails, prints an error.

---

## 🔍 3. `find` Command

**Purpose**: Search for files/directories based on name, type, permission, and more.

### 🔧 Examples:

```bash
find . -name "main.py"
```

Finds `main.py` in the current and subdirectories.

```bash
sudo find /etc -name "*.conf"
```

Finds all `.conf` files in `/etc`.

```bash
find . -type d -name "config"
```

Finds directories named "config".

```bash
find . -perm 664
```

Finds files with permission `664`.

---

## 📤 4. Input/Output Redirection

### Output Redirection

* `>` → Overwrite file
* `>>` → Append to file

```bash
ls > files.txt
```

Overwrites `files.txt` with directory listing.

```bash
echo "New line" >> files.txt
```

Appends to the file.

### Input Redirection

```bash
sort < contacts.txt > sorted_contacts.txt
```

Sorts content of `contacts.txt` and saves it.

---

## ✨ 5. Aliases

**Purpose**: Create shortcuts for frequently used or complex commands.

### 🔧 Examples:

```bash
alias ll='ls -la'
alias c='clear'
alias install='sudo apt install'
alias sup='sudo'
alias gerp='grep'
```

Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` and reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 📦 Custom Command Example:

```bash
alias sysboost='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoclean'
```

---

## 🖐 6. Bonus (macOS Only): Use Touch ID for `sudo`

Edit PAM configuration:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/pam.d/sudo
```

Add at the top:

```bash
auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so
```

Then in iTerm:

1. Go to Preferences → Advanced → Sessions
2. Set “Allow sessions to survive logging out and back in” to **No**
3. Restart terminal to apply changes

Now use fingerprint instead of password for `sudo` commands.

---

## 🔁 7. Repeat Previous Command with `sudo`

```bash
sudo !!
```

Repeats the last command with `sudo` (great when you forgot to prefix a command).

### 🔧 Example:

```bash
systemctl restart ufw
# Oops! Permission denied
sudo !!   # Repeats above with sudo
```

---

## 🔧 Bonus Useful Commands

### `xargs`

Builds and executes command lines from standard input.

```bash
find . -name "*.txt" | xargs wc -l
```

Counts lines in all `.txt` files.

### `cut`, `awk`, `sed`

* `cut` → Extract fields from lines
* `awk` → Powerful field processor
* `sed` → Stream editor for replacing and filtering

```bash
cut -d":" -f1 /etc/passwd     # List usernames
awk '{print $1}' file.txt     # Print first word of each line
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt    # Replace 'old' with 'new'
```

## ❓ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is the difference between `>` and `>>`?

* `>` overwrites the file
* `>>` appends to the file

### Q2: How do you search for `.log` files under `/var`?

```bash
find /var -name "*.log"
```

### Q3: What does `alias ll='ls -la'` do?

Creates a shortcut: typing `ll` runs `ls -la`

### Q4: How do you repeat the previous command with sudo?

Use `sudo !!`

### Q5: How can you chain commands safely?

Use `&&` to ensure commands only continue if the previous one succeeds.

## 🧠 Flashcards

* **Pipe symbol (`|`)** → Chain command outputs
* **Find all `.sh` files?** → `find . -name "*.sh"`
* **Redirect input from file?** → `< filename`
* **Run previous command as sudo?** → `sudo !!`
* **Sort and remove duplicates?** → `cat file | sort | uniq`

---

## ✅ Practice Checklist

✅ Try combining `find`, `xargs`, and `grep`

✅ Set up at least 5 custom aliases in your `.bashrc`

✅ Use piping to simplify data filtering (`cat`, `sort`, `uniq`)

✅ Use input/output redirection with files (`<`, `>`, `>>`)

✅ Create compound commands using `&&` and `||`
