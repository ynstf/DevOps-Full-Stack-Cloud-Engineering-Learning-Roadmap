## 📥 1. `git add` — Stage Changes

### 🧠 Concept:

Adds changes from the working directory to the staging area. Prepares files for commit.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git add filename.txt        # Stage one file
git add .                   # Stage everything in the current directory
git add *.py                # Stage all Python files
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
echo "print('hi')" > app.py
git add app.py              # Ready for commit
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

You're working on a bug fix and want to save your progress without committing unrelated changes.

---

## 🗃 2. `git commit` — Save Staged Changes

### 🧠 Concept:

Takes all staged files and creates a permanent snapshot.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git commit -a -m "Quick commit for tracked files"
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
git add app.py
git commit -m "Add initial Python script"
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

After staging bug fix files, commit with a clear message to describe the change.

---

## 🕵️ 3. `git log` — View History

### 🧠 Concept:

View past commits and metadata like author, timestamp, and messages.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git log                         # Full log
git log --oneline               # Compact format
git log --stat                  # Show file diffs per commit
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Shows:

```
3e2349f Fix broken import
ad12c9a Add script runner
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

Review commits before a release or before merging branches.

---

## 🔍 4. `git diff` — View File Differences

### 🧠 Concept:

Compare changes between working directory, staging area, and latest commit.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git diff                     # Compare working dir to staging
git diff --staged           # Compare staging to last commit
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
echo "# New line" >> README.md
git diff                     # See new line added
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

Check changes before committing or before code review.

---

## 🔬 5. `git show` — Inspect Commits

### 🧠 Concept:

Display content and metadata of a commit.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git show                     # Show latest commit
git show <commit-hash>      # Show specific commit
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
git show 3e2349f
```

Displays:

* Commit message
* Diff
* Author, date

### 🎯 Use Case:

Investigate a specific commit to understand what was changed and why.

---

## ♻️ 6. `git restore` — Undo Changes (Working Directory)

### 🧠 Concept:

Restores files in the working directory to their last committed state.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git restore file.txt             # Discard local changes
git restore --staged file.txt    # Unstage file
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
echo "Oops" >> notes.txt
git restore notes.txt            # Undo uncommitted change
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

You edited the wrong file or broke something — restore it quickly.

---

## 🗑 7. `git rm` — Remove Files from Git

### 🧠 Concept:

Deletes a file and stages that deletion for the next commit.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git rm file.txt                 # Remove and stage deletion
git rm --cached file.txt        # Keep file locally, remove from repo
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
git rm debug.log
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

You accidentally committed a log or credentials file — remove it from Git history.

---

## 🔄 8. Undoing Things in Git

### 🧠 Concept:

Different methods for fixing mistakes:

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git reset HEAD file.txt         # Unstage a file

# Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit and discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert a specific commit
git revert <commit>
```

### 🧪 Example:

```bash
git reset HEAD config.py        # Unstage config.py
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

You committed too early or added the wrong file.

---

## 🏷 9. Tags — Mark Specific Commits

### 🧠 Concept:

Tags label specific commits (e.g., versions, milestones).

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git tag v1.0                       # Lightweight tag
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release v1.0"  # Annotated tag
git tag                            # List tags
git push origin v1.0               # Push one tag
git push origin --tags             # Push all tags
```

### 🧪 Example:

```bash
git tag -a v2.0 -m "Final build"
git push origin v2.0
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

Mark your codebase before a production release.

  A: Use `git tag v1.0` or `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release"`

---

## ✅ Flashcards

* **Unstage a file** → `git restore --staged file`
* **Discard changes** → `git restore file`
* **Delete file from repo** → `git rm`
