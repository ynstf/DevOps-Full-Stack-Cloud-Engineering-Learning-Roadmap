# 📘 Git Introduction - Theoretical and Practical Guide for Interviews

## 📌 Overview

Git is the most widely used **Version Control System (VCS)**, essential for modern software development. This README offers a complete introduction—ideal for beginners and interview preparation. It covers:

* What is Version Control?
* History and motivation behind Git
* Git architecture and core concepts
* Git file states (Working Directory, Staging, Repository)
* Installation and basic setup
* Git objects: blobs, trees, commits

Includes practical command-line usage and real-world examples.

## 🔁 What is Version Control?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** tracks changes in code or content over time.

### Benefits:

* Track who made changes and when
* Revert to previous versions
* Collaborate across teams
* Create branches to isolate features

### Types of VCS:

* **Local VCS** (e.g. RCS)
* **Centralized VCS** (e.g. SVN)
* **Distributed VCS** (e.g. Git, Mercurial)

Git is a **distributed** VCS: each user has the full copy of the repository.

---

## 🧭 History of Git

* Developed in 2005 by **Linus Torvalds** for Linux kernel development
* Designed to be:

  * Fast
  * Distributed
  * Secure (content-addressable)
  * Scalable

Git solved performance and security limitations found in CVS and SVN.

## 🏗️ Git Architecture

### Key Features:

* **Snapshot-based**, not diff-based
* Every commit stores a full snapshot (not just changes)
* Git stores data in its internal `.git` directory as **objects**

### Main Object Types:

| Object | Description                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| Blob   | File content                |
| Tree   | Directory structure         |
| Commit | Snapshot of the project     |
| Tag    | Named reference to a commit |

### Structure:

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Git Repository
```

## 📂 Git File States

| State             | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Working Directory | Files currently being worked on               |
| Staging Area      | Files marked for inclusion in the next commit |
| Repository        | Permanently stored snapshots (committed data) |

### Transitions:

* `git add` → moves changes to the staging area
* `git commit` → saves staged changes to the repository
* `git checkout` or `git reset` → reverts to earlier states

## 🖥️ Install and Initialize Git

### Installation

* On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

* On macOS:

```bash
brew install git
```

* On Windows: Use [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/)

### Configure Git (once per machine):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global core.editor "vim"  # Optional
```

### Initialize Repository:

```bash
git init
```

Creates a `.git/` directory where all Git metadata is stored.

---

## 🧱 Explore Git Objects and Trees

### Check Status:

```bash
git status
```

### Add Files:

```bash
git add file.txt        # Stage a specific file
git add .               # Stage all files
```

### Make a Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### View Commit Log:

```bash
git log
```

### Check Object Details:

```bash
ls .git/objects          # Contains object database
```

### Hash a File (SHA-1 hash):

```bash
git hash-object filename
```

### Create Git Object Manually:

```bash
echo "hello" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```

Stores "hello" in the object database.

### List Tree:

```bash
git ls-tree HEAD
```

Shows the directory structure of the latest commit.

## 🧠 Common Git Concepts Recap

* **Blob** → File content without name
* **Tree** → Folder structure mapping names to blobs and trees
* **Commit** → Snapshot with metadata and tree reference

Every object in Git has a unique hash (SHA-1 or SHA-256) which identifies it.

---

## 🧪 Example Workflow

```bash
mkdir myproject && cd myproject
git init
echo "# Hello Git" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Check internal structure:

```bash
cat .git/HEAD
ls .git/objects/
```

## ❓ Interview Questions

### Q1: What is the difference between Git and SVN?

> Git is distributed; SVN is centralized.

### Q2: What is the staging area in Git?

> A space to prepare commits by staging files.

### Q3: What are Git objects?

> Fundamental internal components: blob, tree, commit, tag.

### Q4: What happens when you run `git commit`?

> Git stores a snapshot of staged files as a new commit object.

### Q5: How does Git ensure integrity?

> Through SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes of content.
