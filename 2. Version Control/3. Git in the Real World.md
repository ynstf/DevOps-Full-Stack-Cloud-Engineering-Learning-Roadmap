# 🌍 Git in the Real World - Branching, Merging, and Remotes

## 📌 Overview

This guide focuses on using Git in **real-world software development workflows**, including working with branches, merging changes, and collaborating through remotes. Each section includes:

* 🧠 Concepts
* 💻 Essential commands
* 🧪 Real-world examples
* 🎯 Use cases

You’ll also see advanced usage of `git restore` and `git rm` in the context of branching and collaboration.

## 🌿 1. Git Branching

### 🧠 Concept:

Branches let you isolate work. You can work on features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git branch                    # List branches
git branch new-feature       # Create a new branch
git checkout new-feature     # Switch to branch
git switch new-feature       # Alternative to checkout (modern)
git switch -c hotfix-issue   # Create + switch to new branch
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
# You want to build a new feature without breaking main
git branch login-feature
git checkout login-feature
```

Make your changes, then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add login UI"
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

Collaborating on multiple features — each developer works in their own branch.

---

## 🔀 2. Merging Branches

### 🧠 Concept:

Merge brings changes from one branch into another (usually feature → main).

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git checkout main
# OR
git switch main

git merge login-feature        # Merge the feature
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge login-feature
```

Merge conflict? Git will tell you. Resolve manually, then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

After a teammate finishes a feature, merge it into the main branch for release.

## 🌐 3. Working with Remotes (GitHub/GitLab)

### 🧠 Concept:

Git remotes allow collaboration across systems. `origin` is the default remote pointing to your GitHub/GitLab repo.

### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git remote -v                          # View remotes
git remote add origin <url>           # Add remote
git push origin main                  # Push to main branch
git pull origin main                  # Fetch + merge
```

### 🔁 Syncing Changes:

```bash
git fetch origin                      # Fetch changes only
git merge origin/main                 # Merge manually
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/project.git
git push -u origin main
```

Later, pull updates:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

Push your local changes to a shared repo so teammates can see and contribute.

## 🧹 4. Cleaning and Managing Files

### `git restore` — Restore Files

#### 🧠 Concept:

Revert files to previous states or unstage them.

#### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git restore filename.txt            # Discard local changes

# Unstage a file (keep changes)
git restore --staged filename.txt
```

#### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
echo "debugging" >> script.py
git restore script.py               # Revert to last commit
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

Undo an accidental change or fix a file without affecting others.

---

### `git rm` — Remove Tracked Files

#### 🧠 Concept:

Remove a file from Git’s index (and optionally from disk).

#### 💻 Commands:

```bash
git rm file.txt                     # Delete from disk and Git

# Keep locally but remove from Git
git rm --cached secret.txt
```

#### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
echo "logs" >> .gitignore
git rm --cached debug.log          # Remove tracked file but keep it
```

### 🎯 Use Case:

Remove mistakenly committed files (e.g., large data, credentials).

## 🔄 5. Real-World Scenario: Feature Collaboration Workflow

### 📁 Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourteam/project.git
cd project
git switch -c dashboard-ui
```

### 👨‍💻 Make Changes

```bash
# Edit files

git add .
git commit -m "Add dashboard"
git push origin dashboard-ui
```

### 🔀 Open PR → Merge → Pull

```bash
git switch main
git pull origin main
```

## ❓ Interview Questions

* **Q: What’s the difference between `fetch` and `pull`?**
  A: `fetch` retrieves changes; `pull` = `fetch` + `merge`

* **Q: When do you use `git restore` vs `git checkout`?**
  A: Use `restore` to reset files; `checkout` is for switching branches (newer Git favors `restore` and `switch`)

* **Q: How do you safely remove a file from Git but not from disk?**
  A: `git rm --cached filename`

* **Q: What’s a merge conflict?**
  A: When two branches modify the same line or file differently — requires manual resolution.

## ✅ Flashcards

* **Create branch** → `git switch -c newbranch`
* **Merge feature** → `git merge feature`
* **Push to remote** → `git push origin branch`
* **Restore file** → `git restore filename`
* **Remove tracked file only** → `git rm --cached filename`
* **View all remotes** → `git remote -v`
